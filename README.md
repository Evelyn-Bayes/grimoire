# â˜½ The Codex Machina â˜¾  
**A Grimoire of Modern Spellcraft and the Elemental Forces of the Machine**

Welcome, Seeker.  
Within this living tome lies the sacred knowledge of machinesâ€”encoded not in ancient tongues, but in circuits, logic, and code.  
Begin with the **Invocation**, and descend as you are able.
